It teaches the use of a database management system (DBMS) by treating it as a black box, focusing only on its functionality and its interfaces. Topics include introduction to database systems, relational database systems, database design methodology, SQL and interfaces, database application development, concept of transactions, ODBC, JDBC, database tuning, database administration, and current topics (distributed databases, data warehouses, data mining)."

Numerical and graphical techniques for summarizing data and checking the fit of a statistical model will be discussed. The method of maximum likelihood will be used to obtain point and interval estimates for the parameters of interest as well as testing hypotheses. The interpretation of confidence intervals and p-values will be emphasized. The Chi-squared and t distributions will be introduced and used to construct confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses including likelihood ratio tests.

Likelihood ratio tests.   Joint probability (density) functions, marginal probability (density) functions, and conditional probability (density) functions of two or more random variables are discussed. Topics covered include independence of random variables, conditional expectation and the determination of the distribution of functions of random variables using the cumulative distribution method, change of variable and moment generating functions.  Properties of the Multinomial and Bivariate Normal distributions are proved. Limiting distributions, including convergence in probability and convergence in distribution, are discussed. Important results, including the Weak Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem, Slutsky's theorem, and the Delta Method, are introduced with applications. The maximum likelihood method is discussed for the multi-parameter case. Asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator are examined and used to construct confidence intervals or regions. Tests for simple and composite hypotheses are constructed using the Likelihood Ratio Test. [Offered: F,W,S]"
